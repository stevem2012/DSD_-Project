# Mangement system of Parking
  In this project we would like to simulate a management system for parking of the university.
## Technology
  I used Verilog Hardware design language and Quartus to Sysntesize the circuit for an fpga and to get maximum frequency. 
## Implementation Details
  I used Verilog HDL to make two modules, " Counter " Module to simulate spending time, and the main module " Parking " that is the main system of parking manageing.
  Also, I designed " Parking_TB " module to test the Parking module. 
## How to run
You can use icarus to run verilog code 
first run "iverilog -o Parking_TB Parking_TB.v" command, and then run "vvp Parking_TB" to simulate Parking_TB module and see results of simulation of the above moduls and also to get the the vcd file.
Also you can use Modelsim tools to simulate your modules.
## Results 
After running above commands you can see performance of the cicruit by the prepared vcd file and the printed results.
You can refer to doc folder to see explanation of the project in ["Final Exam.pdf"](https://github.com/amirprogrammer04/DSD/blob/master/Doc/Final%20Exam.pdf) File and refer to code folder to see Code of the project in ["Parking.v"](https://github.com/amirprogrammer04/DSD/blob/master/Code/Parking.v). Also i prepared the output of the simulation in ["output.txt"](https://github.com/amirprogrammer04/DSD/blob/master/Doc/output.txt) and also the [vcd file](https://github.com/amirprogrammer04/DSD/blob/master/Doc/Parking.vcd) and the uploded in the doc file ["Final Exam.pdf"](https://github.com/amirprogrammer04/DSD/blob/master/Doc/Final%20Exam.pdf) .
